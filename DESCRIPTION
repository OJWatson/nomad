Description: nomad is an R package for simulating mobility data primarily for
  infectious disease epidemiology and in sub-Saharan contexts. The package 
  provides a range of mobility models that allow users to simulate mobility
  matrices, either using pre-trained models or by allowing users to provide
  mobility data for their context and fitting models to these data.
